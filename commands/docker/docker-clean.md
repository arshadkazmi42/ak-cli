### Cleaning up docker to reclaim disk space

When the disk space was "leaking‚Äù somewhere and you're not able to tell where it went,
clean the unused storage of the docker using this command :

`docker system prune`

#### Example:

`docker system prune` <br>
                     
WARNING! This will remove:<br>
- all stopped containers
- all networks not used by at least one container
- all dangling images
- all build cache<br>
