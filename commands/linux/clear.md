### Clear terminal

`clear`

Clear is a standard Unix computer operating system command that is used to clear the terminal screen. This command first looks for a terminal type in the environment and after that, it figures out the terminfo database for how to clear the screen. And this command will ignore any command-line parameters that may be present. Also, the clear command doesn’t take any argument and it is almost similar to cls command on a number of other operating systems.
